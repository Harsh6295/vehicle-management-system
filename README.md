# Vehicle Management System

## Description
A Java project demonstrating the use of interfaces for managing different vehicle types.

This project defines a common `Vehicle` interface and implements it in classes like `Car`, `Bike`, and `Truck`. Each vehicle has its own unique attributes and behavior while sharing the same interface structure.

## Features
- Interface-based structure for different vehicles
- Concrete classes: `Car`, `Bike`, `Truck`
- Demonstrates abstraction and polymorphism in Java

## Requirements
- Java JDK 8 or above
- Any IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code) or command-line terminal
